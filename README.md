# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

In order to gain a more thorough understanding of the CSS and HTML elements studied this past week, I took it upon myself to refactor an unsatisfactory code repo.  Through reverse-engineering, commenting, and rearrangement I gained a much more thorough understanding of the organizational structure of each language and how the order of each affects the other.

I delved into this assignment with the hope that my skills would be sharpened and that through continuous reworking a much more accessible product would be created.  While I did not originate this website, it has certainly been bettered by my intervention.  I hope someday to work on websites much akin to this one, having experience refactoring existing code is just as (if not more) important than knowing how to code from scratch.

The original Horiseon webpage code had many core faults.  While the webpage itself looked decent and mostly functioned, it left significant room for improvement.  The replacement of the classes used to order the divs with semantic HTML both makes the code more organized and pairs down the extra CSS.  After ordering the CSS to match the now-semantic HTML, it has become much easier to navigate and understand.

In this exercise I learned the significance of using semantic code and the impact that it makes on the neatness and functionality of the code.  I also learned just how big of an impact the quality of the HTML has on the CSS and vice versa.  Navigating both became significantly easier once they were arranged to match each other sequentially and semantically.  Finally, I cannot overstate the importance of comments.  Nothing helps code more than descriptive and well-placed comments.

## Installation

To get the development environment in order, simply clone (or duplicate through zip files) the git repository.  Once you have the appropriate files downloaded.  Then either navigate to the existing website or publish your own copy through GitHub.

## Usage

To use the Horiseon website, simply go to [insert link].
